# SimpleWebCrawler
To crawl over the links in a domain
BasicWebCrawler works on the support of JSOUP - A Java Library for working with real-world HTML. It connects to the URL's at runtime and fetches it's information.
This class provides a basic crawling technique through recursive function and displays the accessed URL's in a parent-child format. The program also restricts the access of external links based on the spcific link passed as parameter.
